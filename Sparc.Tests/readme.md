# Sparc.Tests

This library aims to create an alternative for you to test your app without necessarely need the db infrastructue set up. As you may know `Sparc.Kernel` already have an `InMemoryRepository` implementation
and with `Sparc.Tests` on top of Bogus we want to make available fake/test data

## Why Bogus?
According to its [official documentation](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus) *Bogus is a simple fake data generator for .NET languages like C#, F# and VB.NET. Bogus is fundamentally a C# port of faker.js and inspired by FluentValidation's syntax sugar.*

And it's pretty straighfoward, fastening your development and initial tests.

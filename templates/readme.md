# Templates

Here you find all the Blossom templates that will be available through the Nuget package, once you install it you should be able to create projects using Blossom directly from your `Visual Studio` or `dotnet cli`.

The Blossom templates are an easy way to start using Blossom for API, Web or Multiplatform apps.

For now, you can create and setup your projects from scratch using our [Blossom oficial documentation](https://github.com/sparc-coop/blossom)
